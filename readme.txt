The widget has been optimized to work on all major browsers including their mobile versions: IE 8 +, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera. Some templates are built using the HTML5 Canvas technology that isn't supported by older IE browsers. However the widget will automatically detect such browsers and a compatible version will load.
